Snapshot
========

Assembles the raw session data the UI consumes.  This module reads the local
sources (session registry, transcripts, processes, subagents) and returns a
flat list of raw per-session records.  It performs no status classification,
label formatting, grouping or sorting - all of that derivation lives in the UI
(``agent_monitor_for_claude/ui/logic.js``).  Python's role is purely to provide
data and to keep conversation content out of it.

Every session root (the native Windows install, plus one per running WSL
distro - see ``roots.session_roots``) is assembled here: each record carries
its root's ``origin``/``origin_label`` through untouched, and liveness is
probed per root kind - ``process_probe.probe_all`` for the Windows root,
``wsl.probe_wsl_sessions`` for a WSL root - so a pid from one root is never
looked up against another root's process table.

Everything returned is JSON-serializable and free of conversation content.
