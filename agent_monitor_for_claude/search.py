"""
Session Content Search
=======================

Finds the sessions whose transcript contains a search string.  Unlike the live
snapshot and the history listing - both of which are deliberately content-free -
this is the one path that reads conversation text, so it is tightly
encapsulated: it runs only on an explicit, on-demand user search, reads each
transcript locally, and reports **only the matching session ids**.  No message
text, no snippet, no line ever crosses the bridge, reaches the UI, or leaves the
machine (there is no network anywhere in this application).

The query supports the familiar editor options (mirroring VS Code): match case,
whole word, and regular expression.  All three are compiled into one Python
regular expression, and matching is **line-based** (each JSONL line is one
transcript entry), which is both what an editor's search means and what keeps a
regex match well-defined - no chunk-boundary reassembly.  An invalid regular
expression is reported back as an error so the UI can flag it, without ever
scanning a file.

The search is streaming, not batch: it reports progress and matches through an
``on_update`` callback as it goes, so the UI can drive a progress bar and fill in
results live.  Work is ordered and shaped for the on-demand call, not the
per-second poll:

- The caller passes the exact set of sessions in view, so only those transcripts
  are read - a handful when the history filter is off, more when it is on.  The
  ``projects/`` tree is never walked here.
- Each session ref carries the ``origin`` of the root it lives on (the native
  Windows install, or one running WSL distro); it is resolved with
  ``roots.root_for_origin``, a refusal rather than a fallback, so a ref whose
  origin no longer names a currently discovered root - most often a WSL distro
  that has since stopped - is silently dropped, never substituted with another
  root's transcript tree.
- Transcripts are scanned **newest file first** (by modification time) across
  every root combined, so the most recently active sessions - the ones most
  likely wanted - surface first regardless of which root they live on.
- Each transcript is read line by line and abandoned at the first hit; files are
  scanned concurrently on a thread pool, and matches are emitted strictly in
  newest-first order.
- ``should_cancel`` is polled throughout (per file and per line), so a superseded
  search - the user typed another character - stops promptly.

Parsing degrades gracefully like every other reader here: an unreadable or
missing transcript is skipped, never raised.  Every path is confined to its own
root's ``projects/`` (resolved and checked against that same root), so a
crafted id or cwd can never point the read outside its root's transcript tree -
and never at another root's tree either.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query
        The search string.  A blank, non-string, or over-long value matches
        nothing (only a final, complete update is reported, without error).
    sessions
        The sessions currently in view, each a mapping with ``session_id``,
        ``cwd`` and (when known) ``origin`` - the session root it lives on.  An
        absent or non-string ``origin`` defaults to the native Windows root,
        matching every caller from before origin-tagging existed.  Only these
        transcripts are read, so the scope and cost are exactly what the user
        can see.
    options
        A mapping with the boolean search options ``match_case``, ``whole_word``
        and ``use_regex`` (mirroring the editor toggles).  Absent keys are false.
    on_update
        Called as ``(processed, total, matches, done, error)``: how many
        transcripts have been scanned, how many in all, any newly matched session
        ids since the last update (newest first, each once), whether the scan has
        finished, and whether the query was an invalid regular expression.
        ``matches`` carries only ids - never any content.  A final call always
        arrives with ``done=True``.
    should_cancel
        Polled throughout; when it returns true the scan stops as soon as
        possible (no further updates).
