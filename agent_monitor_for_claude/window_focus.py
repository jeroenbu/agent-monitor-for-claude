"""
Window Focus
============

Brings the window hosting a session to the foreground when the user clicks
its entry.  The session's live ancestor chain supplies the candidate host
processes; their visible top-level windows are enumerated and, for hosts
that keep several windows in one process (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs), the
window whose title mentions the session's project is preferred.

A session driven through an external terminal owns no window on its process
chain: a classic console window belongs to a ``conhost.exe`` child of the
shell, and Windows' default-terminal handoff routes the console to a separate
Windows Terminal process with no link back to the shell.  For those the
ancestor search finds nothing, so a fallback matches the session title - which
Claude Code sets as the terminal title - against windows owned by a known
terminal or console host.

A session running inside a WSL distribution has no Windows process at all -
the agent runs inside the distro, so there is no pid and no ancestor chain to
walk in the first place.  ``app.py`` routes those sessions straight to
:func:`focus_terminal_window`, the same title-only match used as the
fallback above, skipping the pid-based search entirely.

Side effects are limited to Win32 window enumeration and activation, and run
only on an explicit user click.  Window titles are compared in memory to pick
the right window - never stored, logged, or displayed.
