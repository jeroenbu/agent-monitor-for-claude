"""
Transcript Metadata
===================

Reads a session transcript and extracts **only** control-flow metadata:
entry type, the last assistant turn's ``stop_reason``, tool-request/result
IDs (to detect an unanswered request), the last tool's name, whether the newest
user turn is Claude Code's interrupt marker, whether a trailing turn is an API
error (and whether that error is a usage/session limit), timestamps, the model
name, aggregated token-usage numbers, and the session title (the ``aiTitle`` Claude
Code generates for its own session list, or the ``customTitle`` the user set by
renaming the session - display metadata, not conversation content).

This module is the privacy boundary of the application.  It must never read,
return, store, or expose conversation content - message ``text``, ``thinking``
blocks, tool ``input``, or tool-result ``content`` are never accessed.  The
narrow exceptions yield only metadata, never the surrounding content: the
sanctioned title read above, and matching the fixed interrupt-marker string to
a boolean entry kind.  A dedicated test enforces this.
