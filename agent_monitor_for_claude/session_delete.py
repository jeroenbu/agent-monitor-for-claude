"""
Session Deletion
================

Deletes a past session's on-disk transcript and its subagent folder.  This is
the application's **only** sanctioned file-deletion surface: everything else is
strictly read-only.  It exists so the UI can offer a "delete" action for the
history listing (past, non-live sessions), removing an old conversation from
disk - and thus from Claude Code's ``--resume`` list - for good.

Three guards keep it safe:

* the session id must be a UUID, so nothing but a well-formed session file name
  can ever be targeted;
* it refuses outright if the session currently has a **live** process (a
  race-condition guard: a session that started up between the UI listing it and
  the click must never have its files pulled out from under a running Claude
  Code);
* the computed paths are confined to ``projects/`` - a stale path, a traversal
  attempt, or anything resolving outside is a no-op.

Only file removal happens here; there is no other side effect.
