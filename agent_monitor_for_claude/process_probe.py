"""
Process Probe
=============

Isolates the process-introspection side effects.  A single scan of the
process table per snapshot answers, for every session at once: is the process
alive, is a tool currently executing (meaningful child process), which
application hosts it right now, and is it driven through the CLI (a shell
sits between the session process and its GUI host).  Working from one scan
keeps the result current on every poll and avoids per-PID process walks.
Only process names, parent links, and start times are inspected here - never
command lines or arguments.

``process_stats`` is a separate, on-demand path: it reports live CPU, memory
(RSS), and uptime for one session's descendant processes, and is used only
while the user has the process panel open.  It opens a handle per descendant
(a handful, not the whole table), which is why it stays out of the per-second
snapshot scan above.  It still reads no command line or argument.

When the registry record carries the original process start time (``procStart``,
.NET ticks of the local wall clock), it is compared against the live process:
a mismatch means Windows recycled the PID for an unrelated process and the
registry entry is stale, so the session is reported as not alive.

    CPU is the raw per-process figure where 100% is one fully-used core (and a

    When the session uses WSL, that VM's own usage (``vmmem*``) is appended as a
