"""
Subagents
=========

Counts the subagents a session is currently running and how many recently
finished, from the per-session subagent transcripts Claude Code writes under
``projects/<slug>/<session>/subagents/`` (directly, and nested under
``workflows/<wf>/`` for workflow-spawned agents).

A subagent within the active window is running until its transcript shows a
completed, settled turn (see ``_is_finished``); older ones have long finished.
Only control fields are read - file timestamps, the transcript tail's entry
``type``/``stop_reason``/block ``type``, and each ``meta.json``'s two display
fields (``agentType``, ``description``) - never the subagent's own
conversation content.

For a workflow (``workflows/<run>/``) the per-agent files leave a gap between
fan-out phases where no single agent is momentarily running, which would make
the whole workflow flicker between "your turn" and "working". So each run's
``journal.jsonl`` is read as a workflow-level signal: it records one ``started``
and one ``result`` event per agent, giving both the run's total agent count and
whether it is still active. Only each event's ``type`` and ``agentId`` decide the
counts; a ``result`` event's payload (the agent's returned content) is never
accessed or surfaced.
