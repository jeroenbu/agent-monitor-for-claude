Session History
===============

Lists past, non-live sessions - the conversations that still have a transcript
under ``projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`` but no longer have a process running.
These are the sessions Claude Code offers under ``--resume``; the live overview
(:func:`snapshot.build_snapshot`) never shows them because it is driven purely
by the session registry, which is pruned once a process exits.

This is a deliberately separate, on-demand path: the UI fetches it only when the
history filter is enabled, so the potentially large ``projects/`` scan (reading
each transcript once to resolve its correct title) never runs on the per-second
poll and never costs anything while the filter is off.

Parsing degrades gracefully, exactly like the live path: an unreadable file or
project directory is skipped, never raised.  Everything returned is
JSON-serializable and free of conversation content.

    Sessions the live snapshot still retains are omitted: those are the live (or
    just-ended, within the retention window) sessions the regular snapshot
    already shows, so listing them here as well would double them up.  The dedup
    is against exactly that retained set (:func:`snapshot.live_or_recent_ids`),
    not every registry record - a dead session whose registry record was never
    pruned and whose activity is past the retention window is dropped by the live
    snapshot, so it belongs here rather than nowhere.  Each returned record
    mirrors the shape the UI's ``buildSession`` consumes, marked ``is_history``
    and always ``alive: False`` (the process is gone, so the derived status is
    ``completed``).

    The working directory that groups a session under its project is resolved
    **per project folder**, not per transcript: a minimal or aborted transcript
    can carry no ``cwd`` of its own, but every transcript in one
    ``projects/<slug>/`` folder belongs to the same project, so a cwd-less
    session inherits the folder's real path from a sibling transcript (or the
    live registry).  Without this, those sessions would fall back to the raw
    slug and split off into a separate, slug-named panel instead of grouping
    with the rest of their project.
