Session History
===============

Lists past, non-live sessions - the conversations that still have a transcript
under ``projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`` but no longer have a process running.
These are the sessions Claude Code offers under ``--resume``; the live overview
(:func:`snapshot.build_snapshot`) never shows them because it is driven purely
by the session registry, which is pruned once a process exits.

This is a deliberately separate, on-demand path: the UI fetches it only when the
history filter is enabled, so the potentially large ``projects/`` scan (reading
each transcript once to resolve its correct title) never runs on the per-second
poll and never costs anything while the filter is off.

Every session root (the native Windows install, plus one per running WSL distro
- see ``roots.session_roots``) is scanned here, one at a time and in isolation:
a root whose scan raises an unexpected error is skipped entirely, never
blanking the other roots' history (mirroring ``snapshot._collect_pairs``). Each
returned record carries its root's ``origin``/``origin_label``, and a project's
cwd is resolved only from that same root's own registry and sibling
transcripts - a Windows cwd must never canonicalize a WSL project slug, or vice
versa, even when the two happen to share the same slug string.

Parsing degrades gracefully, exactly like the live path: an unreadable file or
project directory is skipped, never raised.  Everything returned is
JSON-serializable and free of conversation content.

    The working directory that groups a session under its project is resolved
    **per project folder**, not per transcript: a minimal or aborted transcript
    can carry no ``cwd`` of its own, but every transcript in one
    ``projects/<slug>/`` folder belongs to the same project, so a cwd-less
    session inherits the folder's real path from a sibling transcript or from
    *this root's own* live registry. Without this, those sessions would fall
    back to the raw slug and split off into a separate, slug-named panel
    instead of grouping with the rest of their project.

    The registry lookup (``slug_to_cwd``) is built only from *root*'s own
